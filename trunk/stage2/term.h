/* Some notes about the flags:
   - These flags are used by higher-level functions but not terminals
   themselves.
   - If a terminal is dumb, you may assume that only putchar, getkey and
   checkkey are called.
   - Some fancy features (nocursor, setcolor, and highlight) can be set to
   NULL.  */
